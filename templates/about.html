        <h1>Jada-Marie Dotting</h1> 
        <p>Hello! My name is Jada-Marie Dotting and I am a senior at the University of the West Indies, Mona, where I am currently studying Computer Science. Aside from coding, I am very passionate about all things Art & Design, and so, a goal of mine is to pursue a career that combines both worlds, for example Web Design/Development. When I’m not coding or studying, I enjoy watching football, dancing and crocheting in my free time.</p>
